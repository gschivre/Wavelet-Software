# Wavelet Software

This repositori include a translation of the code from http://eeweb.poly.edu/iselesni/WaveletSoftware/index.html in julia. This code contain implementation of the dual-tree Complex Wavelet Transform that allows to make the Discrete Wavelet Transform shift invariant and also give the wavelet a directional selectivity. The dual-tree Complex Wavelet Transform can be used to derive local phase information from an image much like with Gabor wavelet but at a much lower cost (the dual-tree Complex Wavelet Transform is less redundant).
